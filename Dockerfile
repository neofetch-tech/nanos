# Stage 2: runtime. Just the compiled binary and presets — no rustc, no
# gcc, no source code. This is what actually ships.
#
# Note: this base image is Debian, not Arch, so `pacman` isn't available
# here — `nanctl install <preset>` will fail inside this container by
# design (nanctl is an Arch-specific tool). What you CAN run here without
# installing Rust locally: `nanctl list`, `nanctl status`, `nanctl plugin
# list/add/run-hook`, `nanctl --help`. This still proves the build works
# and gives you a portable way to poke at nanctl's non-pacman commands.
